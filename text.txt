What an incredible piece of art. The Recoleta Cemetary did not disappoint, I was in awe during my entire time there. I believe Avellaneda was a former president of Argentina, but I could be wrong. The size of this statue comes through somewhat in the picture--it's massive. And it's perfect as well. A true masterpiece, with the city floating just behind over the walls overhead.
