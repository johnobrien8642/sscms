        <h3>What is Dabyism? (Digital Abstentionism)</h3>
        <p>
          Wow, what a great question. And I'm glad you're here, because luckily
          I'm more than happy to explain it to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dabyism is a moral philosophical movement concerned with the relationship between
          human beings and the internet.
        </p>
        <p>
          To understand what Dabyism is (or Digital Abstentionism) you first
          have to understand the belief that digital art and broadcast digital communication
          --think social media, or now so-called "news organizations"--are not real. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The reason that a Dabyist believes that digital art is not real is because a Dabyist believes that one of the
          core foundational aspects of art is the ability for the experiencer of the art and 
          the art piece itself to form a relationship. Dabyism doesn't concern 
          itself with the nature of this relationship, it is simply whether or not it's possible 
          for that relationship to form. A Dabyist believes that digital art is not real because they believe human beings 
          can never form a true relationship with a piece of art created for and distributed through the internet.
        </p>
        <p>
          The reason that a Dabyist believes that broadcast digital communication is not real is similar to
          why they believe that digital art is not real; the feeling of forming a relationship with a person
          conducting any kind of broadcast digital communication can easily feel like a relationship--but
          this relationship carries much deeper implications because of its connection to the surveillance that 
          you are under while trying to enjoy that experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          A shared aspect of both digital art and broadband digital communication is the understanding
          that both things--when being consumed through any internet based system--are attached to vast and
          complex systems of surveillance that are quite literally watching you while you observe or interact 
          with these things. This is an aspect of digital art and broadband digital communication that are not 
          shared with their physical counterparts. A painting doesn't watch you watching it. A book doesn't read 
          you while you read it. A CD or tape doesn't listen to you while you listen to it. But this privacy 
          is not present in nearly 100% of any form of digital media delivered to you through the internet.
        </p>
        <p>
          Imagine going to a museum to look at pieces of art and when you arrived there someone you didn't know--
          but that did know you--silently followed you around, writing down copious amounts of information--times
          you looked at the paintings, how long you looked at the paintings, what part of the paintings you looked
          at--and even wrote down personal details about you--what you were wearing, what expression you had on your
          face, what your voice sounded like, what the pallor of your skin was, if you were limping or looked to be
          struggling with a substance use disorder--if you ever wanted to talk to this person, or ask them a question,
          they would never answer you, and they would pretend that you weren't alive, but rather just a walking piece
          of data--when you look at a painting on the internet, this is exactly what is happening.
        </p>
        <p>
          This brings us back to a similar problem when consuming mass communications from a digital broadband platform.
          You are being surveilled while you read these communications or pieces of writing, and for this reason, in the same
          way that lacking privacy eliminates the ability to truly form a relationship with a piece of art, lack of privacy between
          human beings--even when done through writing--also alters and demeans that relationship.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of my qualifactions for asserting this is the fact that I currently work as a professional programmer.
          I also designed and maintain this website (I hope you like it, it may watch you a little bit, but not much)
          and I have come to understand on a much deeper level how software applications are able to capture your every
          movement while you interact with them, or sometimes even when you're not interacting with them.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you understand this reality fully and begin to come to grips with the truth of the world that most of us 
          now exist in, you must admit that the idea that you could ever truly form a relationship with a piece of art
          or with another person through their writing while lacking all privacy during the course of consuming that piece
          of art or getting to know that person through their writing is completely false. It is not possible.
          Fake has become an extremely popular term now, and why would that be?
        </p>
        <p>
          This brings us to the next common shared aspect between digital art and broadband digital communication; the truth
          of either of these things is that they completely lack the assurance of persistence. At this point in the history of
          the internet, now that we have moved towards a cloud-based database system whereby most people give up the physical
          stewardship of their data in return for cheaper storage costs and less chance of permanent loss, this system also
          carries within it the fact that any server or database system could crash and cease operation in the blink of an eye,
          and in an extension of the lack of privacy issue, any other human being at any point in time could decide to alter, remove,
          restrict or hide your data. There of course will be people within these software industries that will claim that the
          likelihood of deleting someone's data, or preventing them from accessing it, or altering it themselves, or any other interventions
          against that person's will are incredibly unlikely, and yet they remain always absolutely possible. You may have even recently experienced
          the latest global server crashes. These will continue to happen periodically in the future. It is not out of the question that
          eventually data will be lost during one of these crashes, this is the reality of data on the internet.
        </p>
        <p>
          Accepting this reality is very fundamental towards moving in the direction of Dabyism. The internet since the beginning--
          because of its near-magical and monolithic status now in our lives--has assumed a kind of de-facto aura of immortality, claiming
          that it will exist and everything on it will exist now and for the rest of time. There is of course no actual proof that this is or
          will be the case. Dabyism believes that this illusion of permanenance is damaging not only to the human spirit, but also mortally
          wounds any artistic endeavour undertaken with the goal of delivering that art through the medium of the
          internet; it denatures it, demeans it, and de-sacrilizes it from its conception.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once you accept these precepts then you are capable of understanding what Dabyism is. Dabyism
          is a movement whereby an artist commits to only ever creating and producing
          works of art that are never meant to be presented in a surveilled digital format, and a person
          commits to never creating and disseminating communications through digital broadband platforms.
          Both the artist and the regular person will also believe that the internet is only to be used
          for commerce or commerce-related activity.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <h3>The Precepts of Digital Abstentionism</h3>
          <li>
            The internet must only be used for commerce and commerce-related activities.
          </li>
          <li>
            Abstain from creating or consuming any digital art that is under active surveillance
            by an anonymous third party.
          </li>
          <li>
            Abstain from creating, disseminating, or consuming mass communications on or from 
            digital broadband platforms.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Being presented in a digital format means that a Dabyist never seeks to create art with the 
          intent being that the art will be consumed through a surveilled digital platform.
          This does not mean that a Dabyist will not use the internet to distribute the art in physical copies.
          It also doesn't mean that a Dabyist abstains from ever consuming any digital art entirely. A 
          Dabyist abstains from consuming or creating digital art that is under active surveillance, and 
          a Dabyist never chooses to produce communications with the intent of distributing them for broadband
          mass communication through digital broadband platforms.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dabyism also isn't concerned with digital instruments used to create art, such as digital lights, or
          digital guitar amplifiers, etc. Dabyism is not neo-Ludditism. Dabyism is only concenred with art or
          communications where active surveillance by a third party is an inherent part of the experience of 
          the art or communication.
        </p>
        <h3>Why Digital Abstentionism?</h3>
        <p>
          Over the years I've watched the world completely change around me. I've found that this has been a common
          experience for people everywhere, living under this new regime. I believe in humanity and the ability of 
          civilization to move forward towards a better future, but throughout history times have arisen where new
          philosophies are needed to contend with radical environmental changes.
        </p>
        <p>
          I would like to mention too that these are ideals that I have created that I attempt to live by. I of course
          am not perfect, and I don't expect I ever could be, but I have found that I have created a loose version
          of Dabyism that I have tried to live under more and more over the years, and when I have gotten closer to practicing
          Dabyism in my artistic and personal life I have reaped the spiritual and emotional benefits of doing so.
        </p>
        <p>
          I do understand that even 5 years ago a philosophy like Dabyism would appear even odder than it may appear to
          you now. But things have changed, and now people exist in a world that lacks any kind of moral or philosophical
          framework to help them understand what the best relationship is that they could have with this new technological
          power that we all possess. That's one of the main reasons that I've created Dabyism.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another reason that I've created Dabyism is because I fear the ability for government to oppress its people. The
          promise of the internet appeared to be a good one in the beginning. I remember the first cell phones appearing in school
          when I was around 11 years old. From that time there is something about the power of the internet and the software that
          runs within it that has affected all of our lives. We fear questioning it because of how fast and powerful it is, so much
          so that I fear the negative realities of an internet-based society are rarely, if ever, discussed.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the main reasons to move back towards the dissemination of information through physical formats--like leaflets,
          flyers or pamphlets--is because the physical format is impossible to eradicate. The Bible, for example, was a book slated
          for destruction many times during its infancy. Kings and empires possibly far more barbaric than ours today massacred 
          millions of people in the hopes of extinguishing Christianity, and at the same time also embarked on the mission to
          try to eradicate all copies of the Bible. This of course clearly failed. Irregardless of the religion itself, the attempts to
          burn every copy of the bible, even in post-biblical times, failed spectacularly, to the point that it hasn't been attempted
          again for over a thousand years. There is no known ability to destroy or suppress the  distribution of a physical copy of a 
          piece of writing, beyond blowing up the Earth itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Compare this with the internet. Controlling information on the internet is as easy as possessing the correct key words and the
          appropriate amount of access to databases. Every piece of information on the internet by definition can be found and retrieved
          at any given point in time. Every time you save something on the internet, that saved piece of data has an address, and every
          copy of it also has an address. Compared with scouring the Earth itself to try to burn every copy of a book or a pamphlet, burning
          every piece of offending data is as simple as identifying the data itself. Coupled with surveillance from countless third parties,
          controlling information on the internet is an actual achievable end that any government or powerful third party 
          willing to embark on, and could be successful. A book hidden on Earth could be anywhere, a piece of data on the internet is always
          somewhere close.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is also the matter that no piece of digital literature has as of yet had any profound impact on civilization. Social movements
          born out of the internet have, again, been more of a matter of group surveillance and mass persecution, rather than a persuasion
          through the force and complexity of argument. Again, irregardless of your opinion of something like Marxism, take Marxism, which you 
          cannot deny flourished and changed the world because of its ability to persuade, but also because it could be read in privacy 
          without any concern of surveillance, and because a person could trust that the book they set down on their nightstand was the same
          book they picked back up in the morning, and because the copies of the work could not be eradicated by governments.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, try not to think about Marxism, think about what the next Marxism will be, the philosophical movements that will change
          the course of humanity. The internet is still young, but because of the beliefs I have laid out here, I and any other Dabyists
          do not believe that the internet will ever be able to affect that kind of change. A Dabyist believes that because of the fundamental
          nature of the internet, the future of the internet is only further incarceration within a soft prison made of human beings.
        </p>
        <p>
          As you consider Dabyism please also try to keep the first precept in mind--Dabyism is not a neo-Luddite or neo-Amish movement.
          It doesn't seek to abstain completely from the internet, and it doesn't believe that every aspect of the internet is negative,
          or should be abstained from. Dabyism believes that the internet can have great benefits in commerce and commerce-related activities, 
          and that any flaws with those systems now are capable of being vastly improved.
        </p>
        <h3>So isn't this writing on the internet violating Dabyism?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes, it is. I currently am working towards making physical pamphlets describing Dabyism available. Until that time
          I feel that it is too urgent for me to abstain from sharing this message, and so for the time being you can
          consider the information here.
        </p>
        <h3>How can I get involved?</h3>
        <p>
          There's no way to participate in any organization related to Dabyism yet, since I've just created it.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are interested in Dabyism I would recommend trying tomorrow to abide by the three precepts. You
          can find them above. Feel what it feels like to abide by the precepts for a day, and I would recommend
          writing down your thoughts on a physical piece of paper.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dabyism is always a work in progress.
        </p>
